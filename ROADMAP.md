# Roadmap

- Obtaining public opinion
- Creating special `pyproject.toml` treatment
    (for example versioning only based on `[project.dependencies]`
    subsection, __not the whole file__)
- Design multi-comver approach (multiple releases based
    on multiple configurations)

<!-- Describe project's roadmap here. -->
